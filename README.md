# Data Structure Overview

# Executive Summary 
This project utilizes sales data to understand highest spending customers by location (US State). 

# Insights Deep Dive
- Top 5 Customers Included:
- Top 5 States included:
- Average spend per customer was (x)
- However top 10% of spenders spent xyz

# Recommendations

- From a Pareto Analysis, the top 20% of customers spent $x on average, compared to $y for the lowest 80% of customers.
- Based on this analysis, strategic advertising on the highest states should be tested in order to see if it represents over-indexed results.
- Additional surveys could be performed to understand if there are additional factors that are affecting which customers are most likely to purchase in the future.
